    "Consider a spatial field on a regular $n_1 \\times n_2$ grid. Our objective is to compute the Gaussian copula density efficiently for this field. This computation involves:\n",

    "Gaussian Markov Random Fields (GMRFs) and copulas are two powerful statistical tools, each offering unique strengths in modeling complex data structures. GMRFs excel in capturing spatial and temporal dependencies, particularly in fields such as environmental science, epidemiology, and image analysis. Their ability to represent local dependencies through sparse precision matrices makes them computationally attractive for high-dimensional problems. Copulas, on the other hand, provide a flexible framework for modeling multivariate dependencies, allowing separate specification of marginal distributions and their joint behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gaussian copula, in particular, has gained popularity due to its interpretability and connection to the multivariate normal distribution. However, combining GMRFs with copulas has historically been computationally challenging, limiting their joint application to smaller datasets or simpler models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\mathbf{X} = (X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_n)$ be a multivariate random vector with marginal distribution functions $F_i$ for $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n$. The joint distribution function of $\\mathbf{X}$ can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F_{\\mathbf{X}}(\\mathbf{x}) = C(F_1(x_1), F_2(x_2), \\ldots, F_n(x_n)),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $C$ is the Gaussian copula defined by the GMRF precision matrix $\\mathbf{Q}$. The Gaussian copula $C$ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "C(u_1, u_2, \\ldots, u_n) = \\Phi_\\mathbf{Q}(\\Phi^{-1}(u_1), \\Phi^{-1}(u_2), \\ldots, \\Phi^{-1}(u_n)),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\Phi_\\mathbf{Q}$ is the joint cumulative distribution function of a multivariate normal distribution with mean vector $\\mathbf{0}$ and precision matrix $\\mathbf{Q}$, and $\\Phi^{-1}$ is the inverse of the standard normal cumulative distribution function.\n",
    "\n",
    "A critical requirement for the precision matrix $\\mathbf{Q}$ governing the GMRF copula $C$ is that $\\mathbf{\\Sigma} = \\mathbf{Q}^{-1}$ should have a unit diagonal, i.e. the marginal variance is equal to one everywhere.. This ensures it operates on the same scale as the transformed data, $\\Phi^{-1}(u_i)$. However, this can be challenging as GMRFs are typically defined in terms of precision matrices that often imply non-unit marginal variances.\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper presents a novel algorithm that bridges the gap between GMRFs and copulas, allowing for fast and efficient computation of Gaussian copula densities using GMRF precision structures. Our method focuses on creating a Matérn-like precision matrix $\\mathbf{Q}$ with unit marginal variance and efficiently computing the multivariate Gaussian copula density of $\\mathbf{Z} = \\Phi^{-1}(\\mathbf{u})$, where $u_i \\sim \\text{Uniform}(0, 1)$, $i = 1, \\dots, n$.\n",

    "where $\\mathbf{Q}_\\rho$ is the precision matrix of a standardized one-dimensional AR(1) process with correlation $\\rho$ and $\\otimes$ denotes the Kronecker product. By employing efficient eigendecomposition techniques, our method avoids explicit formation and inversion of the large precision matrix $\\mathbf{Q}$, making it particularly suitable for high-dimensional spatial data. In addition to the exact method, we show how the precision matrix can be approximated by a folded circulant matrix wich gives a large speed-up while preserving suitable boundary conditions.\n",

    "### Step 1: Eigendecomposition of $\\mathbf{Q}_{\\rho}$\n",

    "\\mathbf{Q} = (\\mathbf{V_{\\rho_1}} \\otimes \\mathbf{V_{\\rho_2}})(\\mathbf{\\Lambda_{\\rho_1}} \\otimes \\mathbf{I} + \\mathbf{I} \\otimes \\mathbf{\\Lambda_{\\rho_2}})^{(\\nu + 1)}(\\mathbf{V_{\\rho_1}} \\otimes \\mathbf{V_{\\rho_2}})^T.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We don’t work with the full eigendecomposition, but rather utilize the fact that the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf Q$ are $\\left\\{\\lambda_{\\rho_1}\\right\\}_i + \\left\\{\\lambda_{\\rho_2}\\right\\}_j$ and their corresponding eigenvectors are $\\left\\{\\mathbf{v}_{\\rho_1}\\right\\}_i \\otimes \\left\\{\\mathbf{v}_{\\rho_2}\\right\\}_j$ to iterate over each value and vector pair to compute the density without forming the larger matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Computation of Marginal Standard Deviations\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to scale $\\mathbf Q$ so that its inverse is a correlation matrix, we first calculate $\\sigma_i = \\sqrt\\Sigma_{ii}$, $i = 1, \\dots, n_1n_2$. We then use these marginal standard deviations to scale the eigenvectors and values. The inverse of $Q$ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\boldsymbol \\Sigma = \\mathbf Q^{-1} = (VAV^T)^{-1} = VA^{-1}V\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagonal elements, $\\boldsymbol \\Sigma_{ii}$, are given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Sigma_{ii} = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} v_{ik} \\frac{1}{\\lambda_k} (v^T)_{ki} = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} v_{ik} \\frac{1}{\\lambda_k} v_{ik} = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} v_{ik}^2 \\frac{1}{\\lambda_k}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the $i$’th marginal variance, $\\sigma_i^2$, is a weighted sum of the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf Q$ where the weights are the squares of the $i$’th value in each eigenvector. This means that we can calculate the marginal standard deviations by iterating over the eigenvalues and -vectors of $Q_{\\rho_1}$ and $Q_{\\rho_2}$ and cumulating their values according to the formula above, then taking the element-wise square roots.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Scaling the Eigendecomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "To scale the eigendecomposition of $\\mathbf{Q}$ using the marginal standard deviations, we define a diagonal matrix $\\mathbf{D}$, where $D_{ii} = \\sigma_i$ and scale the precision matrix as:\n",

    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",

    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Efficient Computation of Log-Density\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this scaled eigendecomposition, we efficiently compute:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Log-determinant: $\\log|\\mathbf{\\widetilde Q}| = \\sum_{i,j} \\log(\\widetilde\\lambda_{ij})$, where $\\widetilde\\lambda_{ij}$ is $\\left( \\left\\{\\lambda_{\\rho_1}\\right\\}_i + \\left\\{\\lambda_{\\rho_2}\\right\\}_j \\right)^{\\nu+1}$ after rescaling with marginal standard deviations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Quadratic form: $\\mathbf{z}^T\\mathbf{\\widetilde Q}\\mathbf{z} = \\sum_{i,j} (\\widetilde\\lambda_{ij}) y_{ij}^2$, where $y_{ij} = \\left(\\left\\{\\mathbf{v}_{\\rho_1}\\right\\}_i \\otimes \\left\\{\\mathbf{v}_{\\rho_2}\\right\\}_j\\right)^T\\mathbf{z}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows us to calculate the density of the spatial copula by calculating and iterating over the spectral decomposition of the smaller matrices, avoiding the formation of $\\mathbf Q$ alltogether.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Circulant and Folded Circulant Approximations\n",
    "\n",
    "While the eigendecomposition method provides an exact solution, it can be computationally expensive for very large spatial fields. To address this, we introduce circulant and folded circulant approximations that offer potential computational advantages.\n",
