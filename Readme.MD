This repository contains the a work-in-progress manuscrips, which explores computational methods for Gaussian copulas using the GMRF approximation to the Mat√©rn covariance function.

The paper can be found here: https://bggj.is/materneigenpaper/

An R package that implements these methods using `{Rcpp}` can be found here: https://github.com/bgautijonsson/stdmatern

A repo that contains case studies using Stan to model processes with these methods can be found here: https://github.com/bgautijonsson/copulas
